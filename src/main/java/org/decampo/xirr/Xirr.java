/**
 * Calculates the irregular rate of return on a series of transactions.  The
 * irregular rate of return is the constant rate for which, if the transactions
 * had been applied to an investment with that rate, the same resulting returns
 * would be realized.
 * <p>
 * When creating the list of {@link Transaction} instances to feed Xirr, be
 * sure to include one transaction representing the present value of the account
 * now, as if you had cashed out the investment.
 * <p>
 * The default number of days per year used for calculation is 365 (ACT/365), but it is possible to override this at the point of
 * construction, or with the withDaysInYear builder option
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <code>
 *     double rate = new Xirr(
 *             new Transaction(-1000, "2016-01-15"),
 *             new Transaction(-2500, "2016-02-08"),
 *             new Transaction(-1000, "2016-04-17"),
 *             new Transaction( 5050, "2016-08-24")
 *         ).xirr();
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * Example using the builder to gain more control:
 * <code>
 *     double rate = Xirr.builder()
 *         .withNewtonRaphsonBuilder(
 *             NewtonRaphson.builder()
 *                 .withIterations(1000)
 *                 .withTolerance(0.0001))
 *         .withGuess(.20)
 *         .withTransactions(
 *             new Transaction(-1000, "2016-01-15"),
 *             new Transaction(-2500, "2016-02-08"),
 *             new Transaction(-1000, "2016-04-17"),
 *             new Transaction( 5050, "2016-08-24")
 *         ).xirr();
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * This class is not thread-safe and is designed for each instance to be used
 * once.
